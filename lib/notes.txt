1. Container
--> It is a widget that combines common painting, positioning and sizing of child widgets.
--> It is also a class to store one or more widgets and position them on the screen according to our needs.
--> Generally, it is similar to a box for storing contents.
--> It allows many attributes to the user for decorating its child widget such as using margin,
    which separates the container from other contents.


2. Center widget
--> It aligns its child widget to the center of available space on the screen. 
For example, if we use any test or widget inside flutter application then it comes in top most corner.. but it will align in center.
