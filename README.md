# Dart Concepts  

Dart is a client-optimized programming language developed by Google, used for building web, mobile, and desktop applications. It is object-oriented and supports strong typing with features like asynchronous programming, null safety, and a rich standard library.  

## Topics Covered  

1. [Objects and Classes](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/class_objects.dart)  
2. [Data Types & Variables](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/datatype_variables.dart)  
3. [Var vs Dynamic](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/dart_var.dart)  
4. [Functions](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/functions.dart)  
5. [Lists](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/list.dart)  
6. [Hash Maps](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/hashmap.dart)  
7. [Const & Final Keywords](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/final_keyword.dart)  
8. [Conditional Statements](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/practise.dart)  
9. [Loops](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/loops.dart)

## How to Run  

### Prerequisites  
- Install **Dart SDK** → [Dart Installation Guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart)  
- Install **Flutter SDK (if using Flutter)** → [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)  

### Running a Dart File  
Execute the following command in the terminal:  
```sh
dart run lib/<filename>.dart
```
Example:  
```sh
dart run lib/functions.dart
```

## Topics  

### [Objects and Classes](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/class_objects.dart)  
Defines objects and how they interact using classes and methods.  

### [Data Types & Variables](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/datatype_variables.dart)  
Represents different types of data such as integers, strings, doubles, and booleans.  

### [Var vs Dynamic](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/dart_var.dart)  
Explains the difference between `var` and `dynamic` in Dart and their use cases.  

### [Functions](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/functions.dart)  
A block of reusable code that performs a specific task, with optional parameters and return types.  

### [Lists](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/list.dart)  
An ordered collection of elements that supports operations like insertion, deletion, and iteration.  

### [Hash Maps](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/hashmap.dart)  
A collection of key-value pairs that allows efficient retrieval of data.  

### [Const & Final Keywords](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/final_keyword.dart)  
Defines immutable values that cannot be changed after initialization.  

### [Conditional Statements](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/practise.dart)  
Executes different blocks of code based on conditions using `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.  

### [Loops](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Dart-Concepts/blob/main/lib/loops.dart)  
Used for executing a set of statements repeatedly using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
